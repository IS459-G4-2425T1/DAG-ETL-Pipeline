# Project Title: React - Big Data Pipeline Dashboard Analytics and Prediction

This repository contains the codebase for the React app hosted at [d3pk4cu0jzisfm.cloudfront.net](https://d3pk4cu0jzisfm.cloudfront.net/). This app includes several components that work together to deliver two primary dashboards for our two data pipelines, and:

1. **Delay Probability Dashboard**: Showcases our delay probability prediction model, providing insights based on historical flight data.
2. **Arrival Delay Prediction Page**: Allows users to retrieve predicted arrival delays for future flights, helping users make informed decisions based on expected flight timings.

> **Note**: The required environment file (`.env`) is not included in this repository for security reasons. If you'd like a copy, feel free to reach out to us.
